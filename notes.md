What happened

Szymon received from 2tango from January till June
 - 1200 including VAT

BPRD send invoices to 2tango from January till June 
- 1200 including VAT

What do we do, when BPRD send an invoice to 1200, but this amount was send to Szymon Maka, who is not in BPRD?
1. BPRD Pays VAT from the 1200
2. Correct the invoices from BPRD:
    1. BRPD send a credit invoice.
    2. 2tango pays VAT backwards
    3. (Szymon puts it in his income tax as “overige inkomsten”)
