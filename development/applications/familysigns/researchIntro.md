## Welcome to Family Signs

Feeling heard and understood is so important, especially within your family circle. Current ways of online communication are not suitable for everyone and can make it difficult for you to fully express yourself.

When you don’t have the words, or don’t know how to start a sentence, Signs will be there to help you out. With Family Signs, you can use your phone to paint a gesture in the sky, send a text message and express yourself to your family. It is suitable for all ages and is especially fun for kids who love to bring more magic into their own world.
