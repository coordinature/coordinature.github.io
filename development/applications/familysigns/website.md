### features
## 1. Turn your phone into a magic wand
Use Signs to paint a gesture that represents a written sentence. What is your first word you would like to sign instead of write?

## 2. Create a pre-made sentence
In moments you feel over stimulated, overwelmed or are in direct need of something, it might be difficult to search for the right words. Create pre-made gestures and sentences for those situations  and navigate easily through difficult situations.

## 3 Build a gesture library
Save your personal gestures and create a library filled with alternative ways of expressing what you need.

## 4. create a shared family language
Share your gestures within your family and get to know each other better.

## 4. Try it yourself!
Scan the QR code and create a gesture for your first word.

### About
## Why FamilySigns?

Especcially when it comes to family, you want to be heard and understand each other.
Yet the current ways of talking to eachother in the online environment is not suitable for everyone.
When you don't have the words for something, or don't know how to start a sentence, the Signs assistant will be there to help you out. Use your phone to make a gesture in the sky, to send a written text message to your family to tell them how you feel, what you need or what you are doing.
