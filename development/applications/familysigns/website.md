### features
## 1. Turn your phone into a magic wand
Paint a sign that represents a word or sentence. What is the first word you would like to sign instead of write?

## 2. Create a pre-made sentence
In moments you feel overstimulated, overwhelmed, or are in direct need of something, it might be difficult to search for the right words. Create pre-made signs and sentences for those states and navigate easily through difficult situations.

## 3 Build a gesture library
Save your signs and create a library filled with alternative means of expressing what you need.

## 4. create a shared family language
Share your signs within your family and get to know each other better.

### About
## Why FamilySigns?

Especially when it comes to family, you want to be heard and understand each other.
Yet the current ways of talking to each other in the online environment are not suitable for everyone. When you don't have the words for something, or don't know how to start a sentence, the Signs assistant will be there to help you out. Use your phone to make a gesture in the sky, to send a written text message to your family to tell them how you feel, what you need, or what you are doing.
