### About
## Why FamilySigns?
  
## benefits for family signs
  
Especially when it comes to family, you want to be heard and understand each other.
Yet the current ways of talking to each other in the online environment are not suitable for everyone. 
When you don't have the words for something, or don't know how to start a sentence, the Signs assistant will be there to help you out. 
Use your phone to make a gesture in the sky, 
  to send a written text message to your family to tell them how you feel, 
  what you need, or what you are doing.

## alternatives
Option 1 (An adaptation to Elise’s Description) 
Feeling heard and understood is so important, especially within your family circle. Current
ways of online communication is not suitable for everyone and can make it difficult for one
to fully express themselves. Family signs attempts to change this by helping you and your
family members find the right words, start a sentence or express how you feel with the use of
gestures and tapping. Simply use your phone to paint a gesture in the sky or tap to send a
message; you choose how you want to express yourself. It is a fun and easy tool that can help
make your family communication more inclusive and understanding.
  
Option 2 (Shortest option for current/quick fix)
Family signs can help communication within your family feel more understanding, inclusive
and exciting.  Currently, online platforms are not suitable for everyone, this can make
communication a challenging task. By using family signs and the signs assistant, starting
sentences, finding the right words and expressing yourself is made easier. This helps to foster
a safe space at home where everybody in the family feels heard and understood. 
  
Option 3 (Closest to Elise’s Original description with an additional sentence at the end)  
Feeling heard and understood is so important, especially within your family circle. However,
the current online tools for communication are not suitable for everyone. When you don’t
have the words for something, or don’t know how to start a sentence, signs assistant will be
there to help you out. Family signs allows you to use your phone to paint a gesture in the sky,
send a text message and express yourself to your family in the way that you prefer. It is
suitable for all ages and is especially fun for kids who love to bring some more magic into
their own world.
