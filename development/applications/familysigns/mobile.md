**signs brainstorm slogans and words**
- The only keyboard designed for neurodiverse writing
- The only keyboard where you can gesture your writing
- Never know what to say, with the Signs Keyboard.
- Gestures speak louder than words
- When all you need to say is a gesture.
- Let your gestures do the talking

  
Because of the Signs keyboard I now:
- never have to worry about being out of words
- can send messages in the way I prefer
- enjoy personalized writing
