    - When someone accepts it on the webapp, do they need to accept it on the native app as well?
    - How often do you need to update your documents? Is there an expiry date and does the document need an expiry date?
    - Do we need a general terms of agreement as well, in the beginning of using the app?
    - Does the protocol dataleaks need to be public?
