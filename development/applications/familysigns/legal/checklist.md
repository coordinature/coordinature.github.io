## checklist

- We currently have the following documents:
	- cookie
    - disclaimer
    - privacy policy
    - processing register
    - protocol dataleaks
    
Questions:
	- can we use the same documents for app and for website?
    - When someone accepts it on the webapp, do they need to accept it on the native app as well?
    - How often do you need to update your documents? Is there an expiry date and does the document need an expiry date?
    - Do we need a general terms of agreement as well, in the beginning of using the app?
    - Does the protocol dataleaks need to be public?
    - Does the processing register need to be public? do they need to accept this?

- Do we cover our all trackings from the tracklist into our documents? (especially our processing register)

- reference to another document where we create a list out of our functions, while we arae building.
