## PROTOCOL REPORTING DATA LEAKS

Considerations:
- 2Tango B.V. attaches importance to the proper security of its (electronic) systems in which personal data.
- have been stored and processed, it can nevertheless never be completely prevented that a data breach will take place
- 2Tango B.V. is obliged under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to report (serious) data leaks to the Dutch Data Protection Authority and to the data subjects
- 2Tango B.V. wishes to comply with its legal obligations
- 2Tango B.V. has therefore formulated a policy to act as adequately as possible in the unlikely event of a data breach.


### 1 - Data breach definition
A data breach occurs when there is a breach of security that accidentally or unlawfully leads to the destruction, loss, alteration or the unauthorized disclosure of or access to data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.

### 2 - Internal responsible person reporting data leaks
1. 2Tango B.V. has appointed an internal data breach controller who is responsible for reporting a data breach.

2. This person in charge is: Tjerk Feitsma, telephone number: +31614034299; e-mail address: tjerk@2tango.org , hereinafter referred to as: 'internal responsible'.

### 3 - Internal notification when a data breach is discovered
1. The person who has a data breach at 2Tango B.V. discovered, immediately report this to the internal manager.

2. If possible, the person who discovered the data breach simultaneously ensures that the leaked data is immediately erased remotely or made inaccessible.

### 4 - Investigation by the internal manager
The internal controller investigates, among other things: 
- Whether personal data has been lost or can be used unlawfully, 
- who or which departments within the organization are involved in the data breach, 
- whether a processor is involved in the incident

### 5 - Combating data breach
The internal controller will stop the data breach if this is still possible and will also take the necessary measures to combat the data breach as effectively as possible.

### 6 - Determining the consequences of a data breach
The internal controller investigates the possible consequences of the data breach on the basis of the nature and the
extent of the data that has been leaked and determines what the adverse consequences for the data subjects could be.

### 7 - Cooperation in the provision of data regarding the data breach
The discoverer/reporter of the data breach offers full cooperation to the internal responsible by acting as quickly and as effectively as possible

The discoverer/reporter of the data breach offers full cooperation to the internal responsible by answering the following questions as quickly and as well as possible (in writing):

- what happened? (description of the incident)
- was it by accident or was it caused by malicious intent (think hacked data)?
- when did it happen? (date and time)
- when was it discovered?
- what kind of data (registers) have been leaked?
- is the data encrypted, and if so how?
- could the data be remotely erased or made inaccessible, and if so, was this done?
- what are the possible consequences for those involved?
- which group(s) of people is/are affected by this? (example: students, patients, premium members)
- how many people are (approximately) affected by this?
- are data of persons in other EU countries also affected by the data breach?
- have technical and/or organizational measures been taken as a result of the incident?

### 8 - Availability of staff after discovery of data breach
The person in charge of the department from which the data breach took place as well as the discoverer of the data breach and anyone who, based on their position or knowledge, is able to take organizational and/or technical measures to limit the consequences of the data breach, adhere to the 1st Available 24 hours after discovery of the data breach for consultation with the internal manager or any experts designated by him and for carrying out assigned work as a result of the data breach if necessary.

### 9 - Decision on notification of data breaches
1. The internal responsible will decide as soon as possible, but in any case within 60 hours after the discovery of the data breach - whether or not in consultation with the responsible of the department from which the data breach was discovered and/or experts appointed by him - whether the data breach must be reported to the Dutch Data Protection Authority and/or the data subjects.

2. In principle, a data breach is always reported to the Dutch Data Protection Authority, unless it is unlikely that the data breach poses a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.
The notification of the data breach is accompanied by an answer to the questions as described in section 7.

3. A data breach that has been reported to the Dutch Data Protection Authority is also reported to the data subjects if it poses a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, unless appropriate measures have been taken in the meantime to avert the high risk.

### 10 - Notification of data leaks to the Dutch Data Protection Authority and/or data subjects
1. If necessary, the internal controller is responsible for reporting to the Dutch Data Protection Authority and/or the person(s) involved.

2. Notification is made as soon as possible after the discovery and at the latest within 72 hours after the discovery of the data breach.

3. Any employee other than the internal controller is not allowed to report the (possible) data breach to the Dutch Data Protection Authority and/or the data subject(s).

4. If an employee does not agree with the decision of the internal controller regarding whether or not to report the data breach to the Dutch Data Protection Authority and/or the data subject(s), he can make his grievances known to the management.

5. If requested to do so, an employee will fully cooperate with the controller in order to be able to inform the affected persons in accordance with Article 34 of the GDPR about the data breach.



### 11 - Consequences of data breach notification
1. If the data breach has negative consequences for those involved, the internal controller will do everything possible to limit these consequences as much as possible. 

2. Depending on the nature and scope of the data breach for data subjects, the internal controller determines:

- how data subjects are informed (including in any case the notifications are made.

- what types of personal data are affected, what the possible consequences are, what measures 2Tango B.V. and how the data subjects themselves can prevent or limit the damage).

- which aftercare the data subjects receive. 

- which actions are necessary in the interest of the organization If a data breach has occurred - regardless of whether it has been reported or not - adequate technical and/or organizational measures are taken as soon as possible to prevent similar data breaches in the future.

### 12 - Keeping records of data leaks
The internal controller keeps a register of all data breaches, in which all data surrounding the data breach
be registered, such as:
- a description of the incident
- date and time of the data breach
- date and time of discovery of the data breach?
- description of the type of leaked personal data
- description of the category(ies) of data subjects affected
- description of the number of people involved (approximate)
- whether data of persons in other EU countries has also been leaked
- whether the incident has been reported to the Dutch Data Protection Authority and, if so, date and time of notification
- whether the incident has been reported to those involved and if so, date and time of notification
- how those involved have been informed
- the consequences of the data breach, stating the date and time if possible
- which technical and/or organizational measures have been taken after the data breach, stating the date
- and time

This protocol for reporting data breaches was drawn up on February 12, 2021.
