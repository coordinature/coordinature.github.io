## PRIVACY POLICY

A better world for all is possible, when every individual has a better chance to be understood. This can only happen, if every individual can communicate in ways that feels natural to the person, even when those ways are different from the norm. Therefore, we who work in 2Tango Signs, dedicate ourselves to work on to finding the best solutions for inclusive communication. Our goal is to bridge the gaps in communication, specifically when neurological and physical differences can create barriers to understanding each other. 

The Signs app, and its underlying research done by 2Tango and partners, focusses on reducing the barriers in communication within the family context. The aim of the Signs App is designed for you to create your own Sign language: A way of communicating with handgestures and armgestures. After a starting phase, these Signs can also be used in offline situations to cooperate when talking is not the best, fun or most effective solution for all. We believe that being able to communicate, beyond verbalization and typing, will allow for those for who this will be a natural preference, to play a more equal or effective part, in a conversation.
