## Welcome to Family Signs

Feeling heard and understood is so important, especially within your family circle. Current ways of online communication are not suitable for everyone and can make it difficult for you to fully express yourself.

With Signs, we are researching the diffferent ways you can use your phone to paint a gesture in the sky, send a text message and express yourself to your family. It is suitable for all ages and is especially fun for kids who love to bring more magic into their own world.

### why join the study
By joining the Family Signs Research, you will participate in the search for inclusive communications tools, using Gestures and Signs. Next to being a pioneer in neurodiverse communication, you will practise writing stories and expressing yourself towards your family. With gesturing, you might get to know each other all over again.

### What to expect during the study
Throughout the study, you receive multiple questionairs that you and your familymembers can fill out alone and together. Together with your family you will create your own private Family Signs group. You will practise using gesture to express yourself and learn to include this the stories you would like to share with your family.
