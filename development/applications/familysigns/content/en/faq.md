### How long is the study?
It will last two months and it will vary between ten minutes to an hour each week. You will receive all important information in your email including the starting and end date.

### What happens if I no longer want to participate in the study?
You are free to opt out at your own will, however we encourage you to stay the entire study as your opinion is highly valued for the development of the app. If you wish to opt-out, we will schedule a final video interview to round up the process.

### At what age can my child participate?
We think that children from the age of 10 can participate well in the study. Children younger than 10 are still welcome to participate in this study. During the first in depth interview, we can help see what might be the best option for you and your children.

We also understand that every child is different, so we leave it up to you whether you think your child can do the assignments independently or whether you want to complete this completely together. We use writing/typing, reading, tapping and gestures.  We recommend that you first create a profile and go through the interface together, before your child can start using it on their own.

Check out the second question for more information about the study.

### my child can't read or write well yet, but they can chat with me. Can my child participate?
Yes, your child can already participate. During the second phase 'Family Activities', questions are asked about moments and situations in everyday life. You can read these questions together, write a story together and practice a gesture. This can be a fun exercise for you to get to know each other better and to practice expressing yourself. We are very curious about the age from which children can already make gestures themselves and may even be able to use this offline in communication with their parents. (Make sure you check the box: 'This was filled on behalf of me.', while using your childs profile)

We will discuss this together in the first in-depth interview, for a more personal approach.

### What if someone wants to join the family group later? is that possible?
Yes that is possible. In the Family Acitivity phase, you will be able to add people to your family group by creating a new profile. Your recently added family member will have access to the family group and the already created gestures.

### My child does not have a mobile phone, can he/she participate?
Yes, this is possible. You can switch from your profile to your childs profile on any phone. This would allow you to fill in the questionnaire for yourself and your child without having to switch phones or laptops.

### Someone in my family can't read well, but would still like to participate. Is that possible?
Yes, that's possible. You can complete the questionnaires together, but do this on the profile of those who answer the questions. (Make sure you check the box: 'This was filled on behalf of me.', while using your childs profile)

### What happens to the data that is collected?
We understand that this data is very sensitive and we have taken all necessary precautions. Your data will remain anonymous, will be stored in the EU, will be on a secure database, will not be shared with third parties and will only be viewed for this research.
