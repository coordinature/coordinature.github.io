### At what age can my child participate?
We think that children from the age of 10 can participate well in the study. Children younger than 10 are still welcome to participate in this study. During the first in depth interview, we can help see what might be the best option for you and your children.

We also understand that every child is different, so we leave it up to you whether you think your child can do the assignments independently or whether you want to complete this completely together. We use writing/typing, reading, tapping and gestures.  We recommend that you first create a profile and go through the interface together, before your child can start using it on their own.

Check out the second question for more information about the study.

### my child can't read or write well yet, but he can chat with me. Can my child participate?
Yes, your child can already participate. During the second phase 'Family Activities', questions are asked about moments and situations in everyday life. You can read these questions together, write a story together and practice a gesture. This can be a fun exercise for you to get to know each other better and to practice expressing yourself. We are very curious about the age from which children can already make gestures themselves and may even be able to use this offline in communication with their parents. (Make sure you check the box: 'This was filled on behalf of me.', while using your childs profile)

We will discuss this together in the first in-depth interview, for a more personal approach.

### What if everyone wants to join the family group later? is that possible?
Yes that is possible. Together you create a family group, in which you indicate how many relatives you have.
This is the beginning of your family library. If a family member wants to join later, this is possible by creating a new profile. Your family member also has access to the family group and the gestures already made and shared.

### My child does not have a mobile phone, can he/she participate?
Yes, this is possible. Because you create a family group and everyone has their own profile, you can open Signs on every phone. You can easily switch profiles, so that you can fill in the questions one after the other and you don't have to worry about switching phones or laptops.

### Someone in my family can't read well, but would like to participate. Is that possible?
Yes, that's possible. You can complete the questionnaires together, but do this on the profile of those who answer the questions. Always click: I fill this in myself or I fill it in for someone else.

### What happens to the data that is collected?
We understand that this data is very sensitive data. This is also why we have taken a long time to develop this research in a good way. In short: Your data will remain anonymous, will remain in the EU, will be on a secure database, will not be shared with third parties and will only be viewed for this research.
