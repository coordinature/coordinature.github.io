### From what age can my child participate?
You as the initiator will fill in most of the information. If you have a partner, you may also do this together with your partner. You create a profile for each family member. Regardless of whether the child has its own mobile phone.

During the research, we look for how each family member can best express themselves in the digital environment. We use writing/typing, reading, tapping and gestures. We think that children from the age of 10 can participate well in the test. Children younger than 10 are of course also allowed to participate as far as possible.

We also understand that every child is different, so we leave it up to you whether you think your child can do the assignments independently or whether you want to complete this completely together. We recommend that you first create a profile and go through the interface together, before your child can start using it on their own.

### my child can't read or write well yet, but he can chat with me. Can my child participate?
Yes, your child can already participate. If your child is not yet able to read and write well, you can complete it together. In the main part of the research new questions are asked about moments and situations in everyday life. You can read these questions together, write a story together and practice a gesture. This can be a fun exercise for you to get to know each other better and to practice expressing your own experiences. We are very curious about the age from which children can already make gestures themselves and may even be able to use this offline in communication with their parents. Always click: I fill this in myself or I fill it in for someone else.

We will discuss this together in the first in-depth interview, so that we devise a personal approach for this.

### What if everyone wants to join the family group later? is that possible?
Yes that is possible. Together you create a family group, in which you indicate how many relatives you have.
This is the beginning of your family library. If a family member wants to join later, this is possible by creating a new profile. Your family member also has access to the family group and the gestures already made and shared.

### My child does not have a mobile phone, can he/she participate?
Yes, this is possible. Because you create a family group and everyone has their own profile, you can open Signs on every phone. You can easily switch profiles, so that you can fill in the questions one after the other and you don't have to worry about switching phones or laptops.

### Someone in my family can't read well, but would like to participate. Is that possible?
Yes, that's possible. You can complete the questionnaires together, but do this on the profile of those who answer the questions. Always click: I fill this in myself or I fill it in for someone else.
