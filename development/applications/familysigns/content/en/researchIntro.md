## Welcome to Family Signs

Feeling heard and understood is extremely important, especially within your family circle. Clear communication is vital at times when you need your family the most. Today's ways of communicating online are not for everyone, so it can be difficult to fully express yourself and get to the heart of the message quickly. As a result, precious moments are lost and miscommunication and loneliness can arise.

With Family Signs we are working on new solutions to express yourself in the online environment. To design solutions that feel natural and suit everyone's unique communication style, research is a must. The Family Signs Research, December 2021, is designed to work with several families at the same time to explore how Family Signs can play a role in enhancing self-expression of needs, feelings and activities within the family.

### why participate in the survey
By participating in the Family Signs Research, you participate in the search for inclusive means of communication in which we use gestures and signs. In addition to pioneering neurodiverse communication, you practice writing stories and expressing yourself to your family. With your own Signs you can get to know each other better in surprising ways.

### What to expect during the study
During the study you will receive several questionnaires that you can complete alone and together with your family members. On the basis of the questionnaires we get a better picture of your current communication patterns, the difficulties and the possibilities for Signs to help you with this. There will be three moments for this during the research: before, during the research and at the end of the research. After each questionnaire, we will ask you to schedule an in-depth interview. Together with your family you create your own private Family Signs group, in which each family member creates their own profile. During the trial period, you write stories, practice with gestures to express yourself that each can share with the family in their own way.
