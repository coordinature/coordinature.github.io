## Welcome to Family Signs

Feeling heard and understood is extremely important, especially within your family circle. Clear communication is vital at times when you need your family the most. Today's forms of online communication are not for everyone, so it can be difficult to fully express yourself and get to the core of the message quickly. As a result, precious moments are lost and miscommunication and loneliness can arise.

With Family Signs we are working on new solutions to express yourself in the online environment. To design solutions that feel natural and suit everyone's unique communication style, research is a necessity. The Family Signs Research, December 2021, is designed to work with several families at the same time to explore how Family Signs can play a role in enhancing self-expression of needs, feelings and activities within the family.

### why participate in the study
By participating in the Family Signs Research, you will be amongst the first to be part of the search towards inclusive communication in which we use gestures and signs that are made with a smartphone. In addition to pioneering neurodiverse communication, you will practice writing stories and expressing yourself to your family. You might be surprised with the ways you can get to know each other through Signs. Through easy excersises you will create your own library full of gestures that is yours to keep even after the study has ended: making your own Family Sign language with your phone!

### What to expect during the study
During the study you will receive several questionnaires that you can complete alone and together with your family members. Based on the questionnaires we get a better picture of your current communication patterns, the difficulties and the possibilities for Signs to help you with this. There will be three phases during this research: Introduction, Family Activities and Evaluation. After the Introduction phase and Evaluation phase we will ask you to schedule an in-depth interview. During the Family Activities Phase, you will create your own private Family Signs group, in which each family member creates their own profile. During this study you and your family members will write stories, express yourselves with gestures that can be shared within the family. Anything you do is contributing and the more you do the more you contribute.
