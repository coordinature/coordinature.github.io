## Earthly.ai

_"Hey Earthly, how did this all happen?"_

We are creating an earthly.ai which represents ecological organisms and processes, through storytelling and animation in the digital sphere.

- Ask Earthly.ai anything about an organism, or a ecological process.
- Or train your own Earthly entity, to be able to track, trace your actions and learn from it's processes.

### Mission
Earthly's larger goal is to contribute in the transformation where ecological wealth of an area is an equivalant to the economical wealth of that area.

We believe that earthly can contribte to this goal by:

- decreasing the knowledge gap between research and the general public
- Increasing the value of healthy ecological organism.
            
We do this by representing earthly matters in the digital sphere, through Earthly.ai.

- Adding any ecological organism, as an digital entity that you can track and interact with.
- Tokenizing the actions taken to maintain their health.
- Creating a search engine where questions about entities or ecological processes can be answered through interactive animations.
