## Starfish & Mussels at the beach

On a lovely sunday afternoon on the last weekend of februari, I decided to go to the beach.
The sun was shining, there wasn't a cloud in the sky and the wind wasn't to strong. It was great for a walk on the sand. Yet to the surprise of many other visitors, there was a gloomy view that welcomed us. Agros the coastline there were hundred, maybe thousands, of dead seastars and mussels that were washed up the shore.

The mussels were all having a long tale or body that was hanging out of the shell. A lot of them were still alive and where only slowly moving when you softly touched them or moved them. The starfish were not moving anymore and had all past away. These starfish don't survive to long after being out of the water.

### What was the cause of this event?
Last week there were three different storms. Most likely the storm caused the current to be heavier and any washed groups of starfish and mussels away to the shore. 

Another cause could be that the storm brought in more sweet water and therefore lowered the levels of saline in the water and weakened some of the starfish, so they were more likely to float above the sand.

In England 2018 there were thousands of starfish reported to be washed up on the UK beaches.
An article below explains:

Dr Chris Mah, a starfish researcher from the Smithsonian Institution explaines: 'In almost every instance that this has been reported, there have been reports of either storms or high winds. 

'Bear in mind that storms don't just mean high winds and rough water current. It also means fresh water input. Echinoderms are notoriously intolerant of freshwater. Low salinity water might serve to weaken or otherwise just disable enough of them to be washed ashore.'
This is his blogpost that dr Mah wrote about starfish around this time with an elaborate FAQ: http://echinoblog.blogspot.com/search?q=stranding 

### Does it happend more often?

### Does it say anything about climate change?

### Is there anything we can do to rescue them, when we see them?

### What is the correlation between starfish and these mussels?
