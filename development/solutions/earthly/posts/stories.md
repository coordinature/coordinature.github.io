### 50 years from now

Whenever I read something about climate change, I come across another research or researcher that talks about how in 1979 the calculations where already saying that we are running out of oil and we need to switch to something like hydrogen fuel instead. Or a rapport that is calculating the impact of deforesting the rainforest, predicten 50 years ago. All of these warnings were warning us about the crisis that they forsaw. And indeed, most of these predictions and warnings still remain true.

How is it possible that the public just now starts hearing about these researches and that only now there is some slight acceptence of the possibility that we might need to make drastic changes in our industries?

Thinking of this, makes me realise what is being written right now, that we might only hear about 50 years from now. When someone says: "did you know that someone 50 years ago already warned us for this? Why didn't we do anything, when we still so much ahead of this disaster? Maybe things could have gone different then..."

This is the reason why we need to make the information that comes out of (environmental) research papers so much more accesable for the bigger public. To make something accessable, we do not just mean: putting a link up on a website... Because the IPCC raport is indeed available for the entire world. But when talking about accesibility, we are talking about being able to process the information. We don't only have to think about who are not able to read well, have a low litteracy or issues with their sight. We are also talking about those who don't have the time or the patience to read.

Writing or talking about climate change, makes the energy in the room change. It feels like the biggest party crasher. You can compare it to a parent showing up at a teenage house party. No one wants the person who takes live to seriously around, when you are about to let go of the things that really matter. 

It is hard to only talk about something, if you feel like you can't really do much about it. Climate change and environmental issues are like a dark cloud hanging above the heads of many. For those who focus on the cloud.

Because this imaginative cloud, is not really bothering us... as long as we focus on our own problems. We can't really do anything about a cloud, can we?
