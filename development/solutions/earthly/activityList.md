| Date  | Description 			| Description 				| reason of stopping     	|
| :---:  |    :----:  			|          :---: 			|		---: 				|
| 2018  | **horizon and pulse**   | a dashboard for governments and organisations and an app for citizen scientist. A way for both to collaborate together.   |  |
| 2019  | **modular sensor kit 1.0**   |    | working together with Eric, Alexey and Omotola.  |
| 2018  | **pulse air game**   | focussing earthly.ai game of pulse first on air data.   | Designed app framework, designed app game rules. Created a list of examples sentences. In need for air data and actual training. Focus shifted to production of air sensor. |
| 2018-2019  | **modular sensor kit 2.0**    | air, soil and plants sensors, first prototyped with 3d printers and later produced in factory | 	We saw that some of the sensors were really bad quality. Omotola suggested we make our own air sensor. The 3D printer had to go back to it's owner. 2Tango's pressure of more interns started. Dare2payitforward started.|
| 2019  | **dare2payitforward**   |     |  |
| 2019  | **earthly tree map app**  | based on pay it forward, to create a tree mapping app. A map to take a picture of a tree and plant it on the map.   | We worked in sue, got to a stopping point. We saw that there were already some apps out there that did this. It wouldn't make sense to make another app with a giant database of pictures, if we didn't work on the natural language model. Otherwise it was a flat version of the app. We focussed on trying to align 2Tango with Mother Earth Network to create mini.ai |
| 2019  | **mini.ai and earthly.ai**   | building mini.ai together   | a proposal was written by Tjerk, Twan and Elise for a subsidy. Tjerk and Twan pushed to focus on the autism part. We didn't get the subsidy due to the autism part, because it made no sense to work together with an environmental company according to them. Tjerk didn't want us to spend time on the overlapping part. Because it would interfere with his plan of only focussing on the neurodiverse targetgroup. |
| 2020  | **earthly game**   | a game designed to train your own earthly.ai consiousness.    |  |
| 2020  | **earthly game workshops** |  a workshop series together with high schools and elementary schools. Prototyping and testing out the UX of the Earthly Game.  | SKVR was interested. It would still be possible any moment. The game development stopped, therefore the workshops are postponed.  |
| 2020  | **garden with sensors Den Bosch**   | Creating multiple sensors for a garden in Den Bosch. Visitors would scan a QR code to download the app. Geo-map the garden. Using input from sensors and the designers of the garden. | Due to Corona we coudn't travel anymore to location. The whole exhibition was canceled by government, we had to go from offline to online. |
| 2020  | **tracking system for plant production/greenhouses** | a system that plant growers can use to start tracking their plants from seed up. Calculating the real value. | needed to have the underlying NFT-protocol. |
| 2020  | **plant library 'plantenbieb' gorilla action** | providing plant-bied-lovers with there own earthly.ai pulse training app. Providing QR code stickers for onto their plant-jars. When people exchange their plants for the plantbied plants, they will be able to scan the QR code and continue to log info of the plant. When they want to train a new one: they can create this through pulse. If they want to order stickers, they can order them through the website. | needed to have the mvp of the app. Sticker part was still under construction due to environmental effects and the transportability of data. |
| 2020  | **impossible bodies AR - own chatapp**  | Creating a new video for earthly, QR code in the VR space of the exhibition to our own app where we would make our own AR game. |Our strategy was to build in Unity. Elise started building experience in unity. Omotola started working on the integration with unity and app. problem: AR kit and AR core would not work on most phones nor did it work on our own. Omotola suggested we should make our own AR-core or AR-framework. (what was omotola's strategy for this?) Omotola got to the point of camera view in app. (why stopped? 3d rig?) Timepressure forced to go into Fectar, because of commitment to exhibition. As a last alternative for our app, we created a Chat interface with bot-ui and 3D model was simulating a short conversation and would collect emails. Unfortunately when deploying bot-ui had an error with vercel. We didn't continue itterating on this version. |
| 2020  | **rotating platform for plant scanner**   | using a rotating platform to scan your plant. Either with the phone, to rotate the plant itself and hold the phone still. or with small camera's that scan the plant    | It had a lot of practical problems for the plant owner. Having to do with scale and weight. Some plants are 2 meter high and weigh a lot, some plants are 2 cm high. The modularity wasn't scalable. For the plantshop owner. Also in terms of extra work and space for this task. |
| 2020  | **3D printed Plant scanner camera rig** | for training our own plant models and hand models | We formed it into the plan with 2Tango. We would first be doing it for 2Tango and then we would focus on plants. Plan: 1.app design for the messenger, 2.pipeline for mvp, 3.dashboard and family-only intranet, 4.3D rig. We delayed with the pipeline and with the mvp of the messenger. Plan was stopped after design of the dashboard. Even though we started 3D rig design. 3D rig design stagnated at the following part: a platform or holder for the camera was created. Yet the part of how to connect the platforms in a circle wasn't designed. Elise coudn't continue on this part due to difficulty with engeneering this circle shape. Omotola didn't have time to focus on this, due to mvp of Signs messenger and work for sustainable-it. |
| 2020  | **earthly.ai - webbrowser extention**  | adding any information to your ai contiousness by selecting and adding in a webbrowser extention.  | transformed into what if this was not only for earthly, but also for mini.ai. Started with building vue browser extention. |
| 2020  | **earthly.ai - search**  | graph search  for earthly questions  | ?  |
| 2020  | **earthly.ai travelplan**  | making a list of locations to visit, to put them on the map. | started making a list. Why did we stop?  |
| 2020  | **earthly.ai mapping sustainable projects**  | putting sustainable projects on the map. | there are a lot of things we need to create first: Such as graph search, and an infrastructure of collaboration, a method of progress checking and activity tracking. Otherwise it is just like many other sustainable project collection websites: not complete, cluthered, filled with projects that stranded and are offline, not being used by the targetgroup and target for greenwashing. |
| 2020  | **3d history teller'how did we get here?'**  | an automated storyteller that starts from the timeline of when earth first started to create live.   | Original devision: omotola focussing on the research facts and Elise would collect questions and form the research facts into small stories. After a few examples we would try to automate it. The first activity that Omotola decided to that focus was needed was the protocol for time and space. Still in progress. |
| 2021  | **DIY grow pot**   		| a small biodecradable jar with a 3d printed seedholder and seed. To sell it at Earthly.ai/store as a small kit. Monthly or quarterly. With a chapter of a book.	| Tolu started helping with engineering. Tolu stopped due to personal reasons. We've Got stuck at the engineeringspoint of the accordion model that Tolu prototyped with paper. The last idea was to not use 3D printed seed holder but from another material. |
| 2021  | **sciencefiction story of future earthly**  | an origin story about earthly matters, timeframe in the future.   | Lost the text during the "big reset" of the folder structures in italy. Elise continued on paper and in booklet, but stopped after a while. Elise found it difficult to start over, needs a silence time in the week to focus on writing. Omotola needed to go through the folder, but didn't make time or mental space yet. |
| 2021  | **invisble edit interface**  | to create your own galery, based on what we did with dagmar.   |  |
| 2021  | **bubble collection of elements**  |An overview of different elements  |  |
| 2021  | **mangrove monitoring and storytelling**  |  |  |
| 2021  | **idea**  |    |  |
| 2022  | **virtual pop-up book of earthly stories**  |    |  |
