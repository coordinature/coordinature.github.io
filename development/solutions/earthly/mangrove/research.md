### 1. what are mangrove?
What?
A mangrove is a tree or shrub collection name. They often come together and form a mangrove forest.

Where?
They are found on coastlines in tropical and subtropical areas.
They are mosly growing in a waterlogged invironment.

- Food: It is playing a important role for food for a whole ecosystem, including us humans.
- Soil: It plays a great role against soil eruption.

### 2. What entities are involved within the mangrove ecosystem?
There are many entities that take shelter in this tree / forest and benefit from it's long roots, branches or leaves. Below a listing of all entities and what there role is within the mangrove system.

Above water:
- Human: ocal communities, interact with the fish from the sea as food. 

Below water:
- American crocodile: _Crocodylus acutus_
- Pink schrimp: _Farfantepenaeus  duorarum_
- Bocourt Swimming Crab: _Callinectes bocourti_
- Hard clam: _Mercenaria mercenaria_
- Gray snapper _Lutjanus griseus_
-  barracuda, tarpon, and snook: larvae.
