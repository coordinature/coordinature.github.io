Earthly Area Entity: DAO
---

First we will map out the area entity. This is the DAO that will represent the area, which will contains of all entities that are logged in the area and represent the estimation of all entities that are not logged in the area.


Research Questions & Goals
---

### Goals we want to meet for people who interact with the gathered data.

Our Current Stage:
1- People can see a digital representation of a tokenized entity.
2- People can talk to a tokenized entity.

Our Next Stage
3- People can see the value (cultural, economic, social, political) that is held in a tokenized entity.
4- People can share the value (cultural, economic, social, political) that is held in a tokenized entity.

Our End Goal
4- People can see how their actions impact the tokenized entity.
5- People can take actions that support the goals of the tokenized entity (DAO) or the custodians of the tokenized entity (Shareholders/Stakeholders of the tokenized entity).

### Questions we want to make answerable for people who interact with the gathered data. via a dialogue/conversational interface.

1. What do we know about this entity?
    - Coordinates: 
    	- Where is this entity?
    	- Where are it's boundaries?
    - Features:
		- What features define this entity? 
          Example: [ Houses, Hills/Mountains, Vegetation, Bodies of Water (Channels, Streams, Banks) ]

2. What can we show you about this entity?
    - Scanning the area for more precize view of the proppery.
    - Creating a visual database of the space.
    - Creating a 3d map out of the visual.
    - Combining this information with the satalite data of the map to mark central entities that can be seen from above.

3. How can you interact with this entity?

4. How can we calculate the value of this entity to you?
    

5. How does this entity (or it's features) interact with other entities (or their feature) in it's ecossystem? 

6. How can we show a global view of all the entities, their features, and the values they hold.
	    - The piece of land that we want to protect will have it's own wallet that is represented by one area entity: a DAO.
    - This Decentralised Autonoumus Organisation will be made up of all the entities that we have logged in the area.
    - The wallet will contain Carbon Credits that is connected to the amount of carbon we offset, that is created by AMCX.
    - The goal is to represent the wealth that hosted by the entity and that will dissolve when trees are burned or chopped down.

With the information from the questions about, we will create a agent for a localised ecosystem  and the organisms that make it up.


## Data points we want to simulate to create an interactive visualisation. 

	Air
		oxygen, 
        H2O, 
        C02, 
        Particulate Matter (PM2.5 or lower wherever possible)
	Soil
    	H2O/Moist
        O2
        Acidity
	Nearby Bodies of Water
    	H2O/Moist
        O2
        Acidity
2. The first version of earthly.ai will only gather knowledge from scientific papers or experts.

### Earhtly Entities within the area
Secondly, we will map out as many entities that make up the area.

5. Mapping out the main entities:
    - What are the main entities interacting with the location? > type of plants.
        - Plants are entities that stay in one position and are therefore tokenized as main entity. They can have their own id, and will develop their own history as we are able to track their health.
    - What is their role in the ecosystem
    - What are the other entities? 
        - Other entities that are in the ecosystem and are moving are not the main entities. Yet we want to log them as much as possible to get an idea of who is involved in the ecosystem and to understand the health of the area. When we have spotted (for example fish) around the mangroves and have a picture of the fish, we can log the fish in as a known entity that is spotted in the area. We can use this as estimates. Yet they will have a more general representation, as we cannot know (yet) when we see this fish type again, if its the same fish.
    - What are their roles in the ecosystem?
    
6. Earthly Entities: Database of entities
    - When a new entity is entered, we start building a general entity profile.
    - Each general profile has information pulled from known sources and information manually added by admin.
    
7. Earthly Ecosystems: Machine learning model ecosystems
    - We have an ecosystem machine learning model, that is specifically trained to become an expert in recognizing what type of ecosystem we are tracking and what entities are most likely common in this area.
    - This goes for: tropical areas near water, tropical areas near mountains, dry lands, wetlands etc.

8. Digital fingerprint NFT plant
    - For each main vegetative entity that we want to track, we can create a NFT that is representing the fingerprint of each plant.
        - 3d model of the shape of the plant on that moment (space/time)
        - Sensor data with the soil moist and ph, the bark width, the bark juice, tree resin.
       
### Monitoring, Maintaining & Experiencing
Finally, we will need to keep track of the entities, add more entities and we want to be able to experience the Earthly experience and share this with others around the world. We do this by using the Pulse App and the Earthly Search tool.

9. Local organisations
    - Which (local) organisations are connected to this location?
    - What is their role in the ecosystem?
    - Who is able to enter the area? What is their role/ reason?
    - Which citizen scientist can be involved in tracking the area's health?

10. Earthly Pulse app  
   - People on location can start logging new entities on the ground: mappoints, entity scans.
   - Logging the status of each entity: pictures.

11.  Earthly Search
    -   This is a public search engine that anyone can use to ask a question about the environment. 
    -   Instead of getting links to websites that contain that information, we summerize a short story and explanation based on reliable sources. (the sources are always visible)

12.  Viewport / iframe plugin
    - A partnering website can use the Earthly Pulse plugin to view specifics properties.
    - A partnering website can use the Earthly Search plugin to ask questions within their website.
