## Research Process

1. What is the geolocation?
    a. what are the coordinates?
    b. What are the boundries of slot of land?
   
2. Satalite data:
    a. How is the area structured with mountains, water, vegetation, housing.

3. Drones:
    a. Scanning the area for more precize view of the proppery.
    b. Creating a visual database of the space.
    c. Creating a 3d map out of the visual.
    d. Combining this information with the satalite data of the map to mark central entities that can be seen from above.
    
4. Mapping out the main entities:
    a. What are the main entities interacting with the location? > type of trees, known animals, 
    b. What is their role in the ecosystem
    
5. Database of entities
    a. When a new entity is entered, we start building a general entity profile.
    b. Each general profile has information pulled from known sources and information manually added by admin.
    
6. Machine learning model ecosystems
    a. We have an ecosystem machine learning model, that is specifically trained to become an expert in recognizing what type of ecosystem we are tracking and what entities are most likely common in this area.
    b. This goes for: tropical areas near water, tropical areas near mountains, dry lands, wetlands etc.
    9. Digital fingerprint NFT plant
    - For each main vegetative entity that we want to track, we can create a NFT that is representing the fingerprint of each plant.
        - 3d model of the shape of the plant on that moment (space/time)
        - Sensor data with the soil moist and ph, the bark width, the bark juice, tree resin.
        
7.  Entity wallets
    - The piece of land that we want to protect will have it's own wallet that is represented by one area entity: a DAO.
    - This Decentralised Autonoumus Organisation will be made up of all the entities that we have logged in the area.
    - The wallet will contain Carbon Credits that is connected to the amount of carbon we offset, that is created by AMCX.
    - The goal is to represent the wealth that hosted by the entity and that will dissolve when trees are burned or chopped down.

8. Local organisations
    a. Which (local) organisations are connected to this location?
    b. What is their role in the ecosystem?
    c. Who is able to enter the area? What is their role/ reason?
    d. Which citizen scientist can be involved in tracking the area's health?

Internal process using the products:
9. Earthly Pulse app  
    a. People on location can start logging new entities on the ground: mappoints, entity scans.
    b. Logging the status of each entity: pictures.

10.  Viewport / iframe plugin
    a. A partnering website can use the Earthly Pulse plugin to view specifics properties.
    b. A partnering website can use the Earthly Search plugin to ask questions within their website.

11.  Earthly Search
    -   This is a public search engine that anyone can use to ask a question about the environment. 
    -   Instead of getting links to websites that contain that information, we summerize a short story and explanation based on reliable sources. (the sources are always visible)
