The IPCC Raport of 2021 was 3947 pages, excluding references. Therefore we do not need to say that there is a lack of information. Yet when we would ask how many people have read it completely and understood the content as well...

Earthly.ai is a digital storytelling machine, that is currently being developed to decrease the gap of knowledge from research to implementation and understanding in the general public.
