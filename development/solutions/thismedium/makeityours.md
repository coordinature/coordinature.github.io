## Streamline the experience

### Create a cover
1. drop a song
2. select a preset
3. add your logo or title


### How the system works

#### Author token
The author token allow people to create things on our platform in a space that they own.
With this token, authors can also grant acces to their spaces and give abbilities to viewers with controltokens. 

#### Control token
With a controltoken, a viewer can customize their experience. If theyr would like to export a version of the experience, they can purchase a transfer token, form the author. 

#### Transfer token 
Just as the author can decide which elements are in their stream viewers can control, they can also decide which elements in their stream they want to make transferable.

#### #make-it-yours
Everytime a user interacts with the controls of a stream they generate 'presence'. And every time a user creates a transfer token with an author, a purchase will be generated. Both creations serve as 'proofs of presence' and 'proof of purchase', respectively.
