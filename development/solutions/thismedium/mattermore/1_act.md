**my first story.**
1. **title** What are you grateful for today?
-  I am grateful for the opportunity to give people a tool to better express what matters to them first.
- [I am grateful] to help people express what really matters to them and connect them to other likeminded.

2. **caption** Why?
- I have seen many people who's mental state got influenced by social media in a negative way.  It therefore became our mission to try and make social media what it was meant to be.
- When you acknowledge, share and keep track of the things that matter to you, it creates a deeper understanding of what is important to you. And if we can connect people on their content, 



3. **description** write the story.
- The current social media platforms have gamified the validation of others,



5. **tag** Choose or write a tag.


- Outwards focused instead of inwards: what does someone else like, instead of what do I like?

Story 1:
It might seem counter intuitive, when we say we want people to focus more on themselves instead of less on themselves.
Because we perceive the stories we see on social media as shallow stories and selfish people who only care about themselves and the way they are perceived.
Social media is actually outwards oriented. When someone posts a picture of themselves, the main goal of the game is to have as much validation on your image/channel/medium from others as possible. The game is to collect peoples validation.
It is not to actually tell your own story, a photo that you found important for a reason... or a memory that you want to keep.
**Now it is about the likes from others, instead of what you like.**
This is a **digitalisation of the "grass is greener on the other side"** or the movie the Joneses.
Wasn't the main lesson from those movies that you eventually find out that no-ones live is perfect? That everyone has their own troubles, difficulties, insecurities etc. And that 
Some people started using topics that they know are very important for some people, as a business strategy. Not to make a change, but to get more sponsors, products etc. to become famous. and be admired. All those reasons are outwards oriented.
Imagine you never saw any of these images. And the whole algorithm wasn't oriented on what is the most viewed, read, liked etc. But it was based on the content first. On finding connections within the context of the story.
When we help people focus more on what matters to them, they start from inner values first. The reason why we ask the question about gratitude, is because the emotion will be softer and positive and about something that happened to them.
Through a **storyteller tool**, we try to help people to get easier to a deeper layer of their story and what they want to write down.
By not adding any like buttons, we break the idea of having someone else having like our thoughts, in order for it to be important to us. Instead you can acknowledge the thought of someone else by sharing something that is similar to you. Therefore we focus on connecting through comparing the context. 
You don't just write what matters to you, by saying: I think it matters that all people should be more kind. for example. 
you can find a more meaningful version in a story that someone was grateful when a stranger was kind to them. This way we focus on the experience instead of the demand for the future. In the end, that is what we as humans have always done: we have created stories that capture our experiences and teaches the person who hasn't seen it from this side, a lesson on how to view their live differently.
celebrate your similarities and differences, by not forcing us all to be the same. And appreciating that everyone has a different story to tell.
We also then don't encourage people to spread misinformation and lies. Because every story is about **'your truth**' and **your experience** and no-one else. And we connect people by their **similar experience**. Which is completely fine.
