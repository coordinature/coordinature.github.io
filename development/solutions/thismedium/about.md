## About

Thismedium is a gamified simulation that improves collecting data results and creates written summaries with descriptive analytics.

## why thismedium?
In a world where information is flooded, a lack of data is not the problem. The problem lies within gathering qualitative answers and translating this into transparent and understandable insights. We dedicate ourselves to creating a platform where stories of matter can be shared.

The current mean goal of any platform where users can write their stories, incentivise users to focus on gathering the likes from others, instead of what truly matters to them. This makes the intent behind messages untrustworthy. Through a storyteller tool, we try to help people to get to a deeper layer of their story and what they want to write down.
