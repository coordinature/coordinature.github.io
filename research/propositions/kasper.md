## Kaspersky & Coordinature
Coordinature will be partnering in the facilitation process of conducting an interactive study about the role of ai in sensitive descision making processes regarding ethical dilemma's.

## Project description
What if artificial intelligence is trained to make desiscions during ethicall dilemma's? In the game of life many humans are confronted with difficult scenario's where one is having to way important factors that might influence our or other lifes. When artificial intelligence will play a more important factor in this desciscion making process, what are the effects on our society?

To map out possible effects, we will host a hackathon where we invite humans to train a general ai that will play a game simulating situations where one has to make ethicall desiscions. This ai will compete in this game against an adversarial network.

## projectplan
During the researchphase we will be running a challenge between a human trained ai vs an adversarial network. This will be done by creating a simple game with affordances, that can run on it's own by using artificial agents as well as played by human players.The factors of this game include:
1. Monetary system
2. Time
3. Authority
4. Societal approval and support

The game will in the following steps:
1. The user will go through a series of multiple puzzles.
2. In the puzzle, the user is introduced situations that present ethical dilemma's. This ethical dilemma is comparable to a dilemma that an ai-developer could face.
3. The user is asked to make an desiscion, knowing that their desiscion will train an ai to play this game as well.
4. An autonoumous adversarial network will go through the same puzzles, without being trained by humans.
5. All users train one ai that will compete with the adversarial network that has not been trained by humans.

### Result:
As a result we are showing the comparisment of the ethically trained ai by humans vs the non trained ai.

What will happen when people are put in this situation?
Will the ai trained by humans still to beat the game? or will it prioritize trying to maximize "being good"?
- which people are going to work together? cooperative?
- which people are going to align to win no matter the costs?
- What are the differences between this

### example dillema's/ scenarios:
- high risk situations
- detecting gender or racial biases
- moral advisers and recogmendations
- court or in judgemental situations
- recogmendation sales systems

###  platform
based on the type of scenario's we can:
- creating a textual questionloop with scenarios.
- creating a 3d space with some activities.

## plan of action
### budget proposal
After debriefing the project proposal, we will create a budget proposal that includes:
- fee's for experts within the field of:
	- the ethics of including artificial intelligence in desiscion making processes.
    - futurologist that are specialised in the implications of ai on society
- services
- hackaton event budget
    - location and equipment
    - facilitation
    - price
    
### Organisation of the team
1. Contacting and briefing external experts for the assignment
2. Reaching out to a hackaton partner
3. Connecting with developers or university department for students

### Development of the hackaton assignment:
1. together with the external experts we will be defining a set of ethical questions, that we are able to simulate through easy puzzles.
2. Designing the affordances around the game.
3. Shaping the scenario's within the game in which we can test the ethical dilemma desiscion making.
4. Defining the dataset on which we will train the models
5. Defining the models
