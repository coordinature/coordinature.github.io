## About
1. Who are we?
We are an experience designer within the topic of technology on society.


1. What do we do?

We are developing a service that helps you coordinate the process of gathering meaningful insights. During this process you will make use of tools that help you:
		- ask critical questions to your targetgroup
        - understand the process of data gathering and organising
    	- report the insights you've gathered

We have worked with: 
- researchers: to facilitate interactive experiences
- implementers: to implement the insights into powerful and simple User Experiences.

- We design an interactive experience that suits with the context of the targetgroup.
- We facilitate the research process
- We provide the tools to do it yourself 
- We design implementation solutions
- We make it possible to present the insights, in a suitable medium.

through this we make it possible:
- to gather insights from quantitative datasets, by natural langauge processing.
- for the gap from research to implementation to be smaller
- empower of the targetgroup by giving personalised tools.
- for data to be more inclusive, by gathering stories from a wide targetgroup.

2. Why do we do it?

We are driven by the oportunity to rethink how information is gathered and communicated in order to:
    	- improve understanding on relevant societal topics.
    	- improve coordination between stakeholders

   questions: 
   - The topic "train your ai as if you are a parent teaching a child":
   		- Does this the ai (chatbot or virtual character) is representing a child-like character? no
        - Does this mean that we are modeling the relationship between a mentor-like situation and a student? no
        - Does this mean that as the trainer of the ai, you can teach the ai any task you want it to be good at?no
        - Does this mean that the ai is focussed on asking child-like why questions to any information you give it, in order to understand the context? maybe
        
        - Is the goal of this excersise to focus on training an ai? no
     	- or is the goal of this excersise to recreate a special bond / connection with the ai? no
        
        internal questions:
        - When the user is a parents to the ai. "groom your ai."
        - what are tricky ethical issues that ml developers face?
        - what are controversial situations in relationship to "I trust the ai i am training"?

ai in companion situations and the influence on peoples psychology.
- how much can it be hacked to influence peoples psychology? 
- When programming these bots, how do we make sure that it can deal with this situation?
- usefullness of programming sensitivity.

Where there are tricky controversial scenario's like:
- people with mental health issues
- people with highly secretive jobs.
- people with dire living situations. (just lost your job, lost a loveone, financial issues, divorse etc.)
- people that just experienced trauma / victems of a crime.
- physical health limitations

or possible problems occur like:
- programming bias
- stimulating negative behaviour or thought patterns with the user

intent:
- the road paved with good intentions leading straight to hell.
- a good intent to help someone.

scenario exmaple:
- a chatbot designed for people with depressia to help them get through the day. the ai is learning based on the users writing.
- ai judging people for a loan, knowing that there might be bias if it's trained on the outcome of loans.

etchical dilemma:
- the ai learning 
- the developer knows that their ai is bias. but their boss wants them to ignore it. Their dilemma: do they risk their job or do they try to solve the bias.

when is it a good ethical dilemma:
1. when it is a realisitic case (this means we are able to remodel it)
2. can we recreate / simulate this scenario

acitivity:
human trained ai, vs adversarial network
A simple game with affordances. That can run on it's own or be played by humans.

1. user will go through a puzzle.
2. in the puzzle, the user is introduced to situation where there are ethical dilemma's.
3. this ethical dilemma is something that an ai developer could face.
4. the users is asked to make an desiscion.
5. all users train the ai that will compete with an adversarial network that has not been trained by humans.

1. we create an adversarial network.
2. we ask this ai to go through the same puzzle.

=
we are showing the comparisment of the ethically trained ai by humans vs the non trained ai.

is this trying to beat it? or is it trying to maximize "being good"?
- which people are going to work together? cooperative?
- which people are going to align to win?

- creating a textual questionloop with scenarios.
- creating a 3d space with some activities.
