## About
1. Who are we?
We are an experience designer within the topic of technology on society.


1. What do we do?

We are developing a service that helps you coordinate the process of gathering meaningful insights. During this process you will make use of tools that help you:
		- ask critical questions to your targetgroup
        - understand the process of data gathering and organising
    	- report the insights you've gathered

We have worked with: 
- researchers: to facilitate interactive experiences
- implementers: to implement the insights into powerful and simple User Experiences.

- We design an interactive experience that suits with the context of the targetgroup.
- We facilitate the research process
- We provide the tools to do it yourself 
- We design implementation solutions
- We make it possible to present the insights, in a suitable medium.

through this we make it possible:
- to gather insights from quantitative datasets, by natural langauge processing.
- for the gap from research to implementation to be smaller
- empower of the targetgroup by giving personalised tools.
- for data to be more inclusive, by gathering stories from a wide targetgroup.

2. Why do we do it?

We are driven by the oportunity to rethink how information is gathered and communicated in order to:
    	- improve understanding on relevant societal topics.
    	- improve coordination between stakeholders
